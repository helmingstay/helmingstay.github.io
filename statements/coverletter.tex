Dear Members of the Search Committee,

I am writing to apply for the position of Assistant Professor of Theoretical
Ecology in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of
Michigan.  I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at North Carolina State
University (NCSU), where I study the population ecology of the {\em Aedes
aegypti} mosquito. My work explores the spatio-temporal dynamics of non-linear
population processes, including demographic stochasticity, invasion,
and response to perturbation. I use data-rich systems to test ecological
theory against empirical observation with a combination of mechanistic
simulation models and statistical models.

Christian E. Gunning, Ph.D.\\
