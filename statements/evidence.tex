I proposed, co-designed, organized, and co-taught this course. 
This interdisciplinary course was cross-listed in Biology and Statistics, 
and had a total enrollment of 13 undergraduate and 2 graduate
students.

An anonymous exit survey asked students to rate their agreement on a
scale of 1-10.  Mean rankings of 10 respondents were as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item This class was enjoyable: 8.4
\item This class was challenging: 8.4
\item I learned new methods and ideas from this class: 8.6
\item This class will be useful to my future work: 8.8
\end{itemize}

Students were also asked the question ``What about this class did
you particularly like?'' Some noteworthy responses include:

\begin{itemize}
\item ``The build up of intuition and critical thinking''
\item ``I liked the format. We were given the tools and allowed to apply those
tools in one final project at the end.''
\item ``I liked the crazy edge-of-the-cliff feeling of trying to think in real
time with the group, thereby revealing much ignorance on my part! Thanks for
encouraging that.''
\item ``this class showed me real world applications of Statistics, which is very
important to me, as in past Statistics classes I have taken, an equation is
thrown at me and I am just expected to memorize it''
\end{itemize}

\section*{Teaching Collaborations with Dr. Erik Erhardt, UNM Department of Mathematics and Statistics}
For an independent review of my teaching expertise, I refer you to the reference letter provided 
by Dr. Erik Erhardt, with whom I have collaborated on several classes, 
including {\em Probability for Scientists} (above) and {\em Statistical Programming}.

%To this day, mathematics and computer programming are still too often viewed as stereotypically ``male'' pursuits. This is an area where I feel particularly well-suited to foster an environment of inclusion.  

%cognitive diversity

%Explicitly addressing the universality of this experience can help students connect with each other, as well as give them permission to seek support.
