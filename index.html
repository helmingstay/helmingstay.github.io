        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>My research uses dynamical systems theory to explore frontiers in modern population ecology. 
I employ numerical simulations and time series analysis to quantify metapopulation dynamics in the 
presence of observation error and dynamical stochasticity.  

My PhD work focused on the metapopulation dynamics of measles and whooping cough, where 
I explored the effect of population size on stochastic extinction as a metapopulation measure
of disease persistence. My current work at NCSU uses individual-based models to quantify the
effect of control measures on mosquito population dynamics. 
        
<h2>Skill set</h2>
<p>My mathematical skill set includes probability theory, machine learning methods, 
generalize linear modeling, and bootstrapping. 
I am fluent in the R, C++, and SQL programming languages, with a strong background in
numerical and stochastic programming and multi-dimensional data visualization.
I also have extensive experience in time series analysis and vector-based GIS.

<h2>Teaching</h2>
My teaching and mentoring focuses on natural sciences students. 
I employ a hands-on, problem-driven approach to teaching probability,
statistics, and scientific programming. Throughout my teaching, I advocate the
advantages of literate programming and reproductible research.

<h2>Status</h2>
<p> I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at North Carolina State University working with Fred Gould and Alun Lloyd on <i>Aedes aegypti</i> population simulations. I physically reside in Missoula, MT.
<p> I was previously a research assistant in the Wearing Research Group at the University of New Mexico's Department of Biology.
