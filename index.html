        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>My research uses dynamical systems theory to explore frontiers in modern ecology. 
I employ numerical simulations, statistical models, and spectral time series analysis to quantify 
population and metapopulation dynamics in the presence of process noise and 
observational uncertainty.

<p>I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor of Biology at <a href="http://www.kenyon.edu/academics">Kenyon College</a>, where I teach classes in <a href="http://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-programs/biology/">Biology</a> and <a href="http://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-programs/mathematics">Statistics</a>.

I recently completed a post-doc at 
<a href="https://projects.ncsu.edu/cals/entomology/">NCSU</a> where I worked 
with <a href="https://projects.ncsu.edu/cals/entomology/Gould">Fred Gould</a> 
and <a href="http://alun.math.ncsu.edu/">Alun Lloyd</a> on <i>Aedes aegypti</i> 
mosquito population dynamics in Iquitos, Peru.  At NCSU, I used
stastical models and individual-based simulation models to 
quantify the effect of
control measures on mosquito population dynamics. 

<p>My PhD work was conducted under <a href="https://biology.unm.edu/core-faculty/wearing.shtml">Dr. Helen Wearing</a> at the 
<a href="https://biology.unm.edu">University of New Mexico</a>.  
I studied the metapopulation dynamics
of measles and whooping cough, including the effect
of population size on stochastic extinction and
disease persistence. 

<h2>Computational Tools</h2>
<p>
I am fluent in the R, C++, and SQL programming languages, with a strong background in
numerical programming, stochastic processes, and multi-dimensional data visualization.  I have extensive experience in time series analysis and vector-based GIS.

<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>My teaching and mentoring focuses on natural sciences students. 
I employ a hands-on, problem-driven approach to teaching probability,
statistics, and scientific programming. Throughout my teaching, I advocate the
advantages of literate programming and reproductible research.
