\begin{rSection}{Executive Summary}
%\begin{itemize}
\item 
My research examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of real-world populations. 
I focus on systems and processes that are discrete, stochastic,
and non-linear. As a quantitative ecologist, I draw 
inspiration and methodology from a range of disciplines, including 
chemistry, physics, and mathematics.
I use empirical data, numerical simulations, and modern statistical methods to
identify key determinants of population dynamics.  I am especially interested
in stochastic extinction and persistence, population responses to
perturbation, and demographic founder events such
as colonization and insecticide resistance. At present, my study systems 
include childhood diseases in the pre-vaccine era U.S., and mosquito population 
dynamics in Iquitos, Peru.

\item I employ a range of open source computing 
tools in my research, including the R and C++ programming languages 
for data visualization,
numerical simulation, and statistical modeling, and SQL for 
advanced data management. I also employ reproducible research tools and 
best practices.

\item I have extensive experience teaching quantitative skills to students from diverse
backgrounds and experience levels. I believe that rigorous quantitative training is 
critical for next generation of data-driven scientists. In particular, I aim to increase
student access to probability and statistics, scientific programming,
and reproducible research methods.
