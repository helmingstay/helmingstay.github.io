<h2>Interdisciplinary Research</h2>
<p>My research is informed by interdisciplinary study and collaborations. 
Collaboration with scientists in other
fields allows me to bring "fresh eyes" to my own and other researchers' problems, and often presents
novel and elegant solutions to known problems.
Similarly,  outstanding problems in one field can sometimes employ existing solutions
in seemingly unrelated but analogous systems.  Additionally, an appreciation for the breadth of
modern scientific pursuit provides a clearer picture of what the state-of-the-art in analytical and
computational tools.   

<h2>Population and Disease Ecology</h2>
<p>I am, first and foremost, an empirical population ecologist.  
My research involves identifying the causal mechanisms that produce the observable temporal dynamics of real-world populations.
My specialization in disease ecology resulted from two main factors. First, the availability of rich
empirical datasets allows me to
test complex hypotheses. Second,  the extensive theoretical literature within disease ecology has allowed me
to "stand on the shoulders" of such intellectual giants as Roy Anderson and Robert May without reinventing the wheel.  
In essence, my research program has been shaped by asking "what's next?" - what key ecological questions remain unaddressed, and 
how can available datasets answer these questions?  
My recent work focuses on two areas of disease ecology that I feel warrant closer attention.

<p>First, I'm exploring the interaction between 
the discrete nature of individuals and the stochastic nature on life history events.  
Extinctions due to demographic stochasticity have received considerable attention 
in epidemic human diseases like measles, where the the influence of population size
led to the concept of "critical community size".  My work matches probabilistic mechanistic 
models with empirically observed patterns of stochastic extinction in populations and
metapopulations.  In addition, I have tested existing theory in novel metapopulations, such as 
modern developing nations.

<p>Second, I'm exploring 
the complex interactions between population and metapopulation processes.
Population dynamics arise both from local processes (e.g., birth and death) and
metapopulation processes (e.g., migration). Local processes are often well-sampled,
while low-frequency metapopulation processes are difficult to directly observe.  
In addition, observation process variability can complicate comparisons between populations and 
metapopulations.  I seek to disentangle "local" and "global" processes, and to reveal complex 
feedbacks between hierarchical levels. To achieve these ends, I use statistical and mathematical
models paired with spatially and temporally extensive datasets from a range of metapopulations.

<h2>Research Tools</h2>
<p>High quality tools are critical for high quality research;  good tools make simple tasks easy and
hard tasks possible.  In addition, using open source tools and 
reproducible research methods allows me to quickly and easily share my work with others.  To these ends, I use the
following tools: 
</ul>
<li>R is my primary programming language.  Primary uses include rapid development, statistical analysis, and figure generation.  
<li>C++ is my programming language of choice for computationally intensive analysis.  
<li>Postgresql is the open source database engine that I use for "Big Data" projects such as the use
of IPUMS census microdata.
<li>Git is the revision control system that I use to store and share code.
<li>knitr is my primary document preparation framework, allowing data to be dynamically embedded in
manuscripts.

<br><br>
I also actively contributing to the R community (e.g., via my <a href="http://helmingstay.blogspot.com/search/label/R">R blog</a>, also published on <a href="http://r-bloggers.com">R-bloggers</a>).  This allows me to hone my analytical and programming skills, while gaining valuable experience in 
novel computational methods.
